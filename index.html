<p>I am a Front-end Web Developer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, CO. I am the primary coder for 26 NREL.gov subsites, 36 intranet subsites, and two U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy websites. Prior to NREL, I was a Web Editor for Leidos - the main contractor for the National Science Foundation's (NSF) United States Antarctic Program (USAP). My most notable task while in the program involved traveling to South Pole Station to roll out the new intranet for station personnel.</p>

<p>In my daily work-related tasking, I use HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 and 5, XML, and JavaScript. I am proficient in Reactstrap, Node.js, and MySQL. I have experience using Git, OU Campus CMS - OmniUpdate, and an in-house Coldfusion content management system (CMS) for website development. My prefered code editor is Visual Studio Code; however, I am comfortable using Adobe Dreamweaver and Notepad++. I am skilled in Adobe Photoshop, and it is my preferred graphic and image editing software. In my previous print design experience, I used Adobe InDesign to create brochures, business cards, and my resume amongst other items.</p>
        <p>I am a University of Denver's Coding Boot Camp graduate. I have a Bachelor of Science degree in English - Professional Writing with a minor in Human Computer Interaction/User Experience (HCI/UX) from the University of North Alabama (UNA). Prior to receiving my
        bachelor's degree, I graduated from Calhoun Community College with an Associate of Applied Science degree in Business Administration - Paralegal Studies.</p>
        <p>I am currently enrolled in the University of Oklahoma's M.A. in Art and Technology program with an expected completion date of Summer 2025. By participating in the program, I get to advance my expertise in object-oriented programming while further pursuing my interest in computational media and design.</p>
